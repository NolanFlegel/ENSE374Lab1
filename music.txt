My music tastes are constantly changing and are typically dependent on an activity.
I also really enjoy live music, I've greatly missed Regina Folk Fest and other local shows.

For focus time/study time I prefer music with no lyrics, often using playlists made from movie soundtracks

My general listening typically leans towards folk/indie/local and I have a penchant for playing an album start to finish.
